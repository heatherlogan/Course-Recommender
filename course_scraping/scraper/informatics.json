We start by exploring the use of modelling in software development. Students learn to document designs in the Unified Modeling Language, UML, with emphasis on class, sequence and state diagrams and the Object Constraint Language, OCL. We use modern model-driven development tools and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We study criteria that make one design better than another in context and introduce design principles and patterns that capture good practice.\n\n\n\nThis course replaces INFR10056 - Software Engineering with Objects and Components.", "Description": "The course begins by placing design and modelling in the context of the various software engineering processes in widespread use today. Via labs, lectures and self-study using readings, videos and formative exercises, it teaches students to produce (initially straightforward) designs and to document them using UML models, both on paper and with an appropriate tool. We discuss the different affordances of these modes and how models may be used (i) purely informally, (ii) as reviewed documentation for designs, and/or (iii) in model-driven development in which models are formal artefacts and code may be generated from them.\n\n\n\nThe second part of the course focuses on identifying and producing good designs. What principles should a good object-oriented design follow? We learn some common design patterns and their role in development and learning.\n\n \n\nFinally we turn to practical model-driven development: how can the cost-benefit ratio of modelling be improved, now and potentially in the future? Students will learn about model transformations, both model-to-model and model-to-text (e.g., code generation) and be introduced to current tools supporting these. We discuss the role of domain specific languages and the integration of model driven development with agile processes. Throughout the course, we identify the deficiencies as well as the benefits of the fast-changing state of the art, aiming to equip students to critically evaluate tools and techniques that become available to them in future."},

Instead there are many different approaches (called parallel patterns) that have been developed by the community and can be used in a variety of situations. These patterns apply equally well regardless of whether our problem is a computational one or data driven.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding and being able to apply these patterns also helps getting to grips with existing parallel codes and optimising poorly performing computation and data codes.

These are implementation strategy patterns and include:\n\n- Master/Worker\n\n- Loop Parallelism\n\n- Fork/Join\n\n- Shared Data and Queues\n\n- Active Messaging\n\n\n\nPatterns are described on an abstract level and we will also discuss enhancements that can be made to improve performance/scalability but at the cost of code complexity. Implementations of these patterns are explored in depth in the tutorials.\n\nThis module also covers parallel frameworks and how we might write generic implementations of patterns which can be applied to numerous problems. Design principals of frameworks, along with popular HPC libraries will be explored so that students understand both from a design and also implementation perspective how to write generic parallel code. \n\n\n\nProgramming exercises use C and Fortran, with MPI and OpenMP."},

Are all `computers' basically the same? Can we tell whether our programs are `correct' - and what does `correct' mean, anyway? Can we solve problems in reasonable time, and can we tell whether we can?\n\nThe course concentrates primarily on conceptual understanding, but adds enough detail to allow students to go on to further courses, and illustrates how the fundamental concepts are reflected throughout the discipline.", "Description": "The first section of the course asks the question, what does it mean to compute? We start with very simple abstract computers, and argue they can do everything real computers can do. We then ask, can we solve every computational question? The answer, which which Turing shocked the mathematicians of the 1930s, is \"no\", with a remarkably easy but beautiful argument (introduced at the end of Inf2A). We then explore some different, but always equivalent, ways of defining \"a computer\". We finish the section by asking how we can compare the difficulty of different problems, and introduce the idea of \"reduction\" as a way of compiling one problem into another. Technically, this covers register machines, undecidability, Turing machines, and reductions. \n\n\n\nThe second section thinks about how hard it is to solve solvable problems, leading to one of the most important problems in all mathematics, and the foundation of internet security. We start by reprising Inf2A analysis of algorithms, and then discuss the idea of classifying problems as `tractable' (easy) or `intractable' (hard). We find that the idea of algorithms whose running time grows polynomially in the problem size is a good mathematical definition of `tractable', though not always a practical one. After making this more precise, we ask what happens if we're allowed to just check all the possible answers in parallel - does this give us more problem-solving power? The question is made precise by the concept of NP, and we show that there are \"hardest\" such problems, such as the famous Travelling Salesman. Although the question is easy to ask, nobody knows how to answer it. This is P = NP - if you can solve it, you win a million dollars, and fame for as long as civilization lasts.   So far, NP problems are very hard to solve in practice, so we discuss how to deal with them. We finish the section by talking about much harder problems still. Technically, this section covers P, NP, hardness and completeness, Cook's Theorem, P = NP, and the complexity hierarchy above NP. \n\n\n\nThe third section considers a different way of seeing computation. Haskell needn't be seen as a programming language, it can be the computer itself. We'll show how the lambda-calculus (on which Haskell is based) can do all the computing our other models could. Unlike the register and Turing machines, lambda-calculus lets us easily use types, which get rid of a whole class of possible bugs from our programs. This \"typing\" underlies almost all modern languages, including such recent things as generics in Java. We'll show how we can decide whether a lambda program is correct in its type, and even how we can do the typing automatically, instead of making the programmer do it. It turns out that this latter is one of those weird problems that is ridiculously hard in theory, but perfectly doable in practice, which bring us back to the complexity hierarchies of the second section. Technically, this covers lambda-calculus, simple types, polymorphism, type checking and type inference. \n\n\n\n\n\nRegister and Turing machines, undecidability, reductions. Intractability and growth rates. P and poly-time reductions, NP, hardness and completeness. Cook's Theorem. P = NP. Beyond NP. Lambda-calculus, through to simply-typed lambda, type safety, polymorphism, type inference and Hindley-Milner."},

The case studies will be underpinned with lectures reviewing relevant theoretical\n\nbackground and classroom activities to ensure students develop required skills. Formative\n\nfeedback will be through class interaction and self- or peer assessed quizzes."},

Its more specific aim is to provide a route into more advanced uses of theorem proving in order to solve problems in mathematics and formal verification.\n\n\n\nMajor emphases are on: how knowledge can be represented using propositional, first-order and higher-order logic; how these representations can be used as the basis for reasoning, and how these reasoning processes can be guided to a successful conclusion through a variety of means ranging from fully-automated to interactive ones. Students will develop a thorough understanding of modern, interactive theorem proving via lectures, tutorials and an assignment.  \n\n\n\nThis course will replace Automated Reasoning (Level 11) (INFR11074).", "Description": "The course starts with an introduction to higher order logic, theorem provers and, more specifically, Isabelle/HOL. This will set the context for the rest of the course in which Isabelle will be the framework for getting hands-on experience about the application of various theoretical concepts.\n\nThrough the lectures and tutorials that incorporate practical exercises the students will gain the skills needed to get started with Isabelle and progress to more complex concepts involving both representation and reasoning.\n\n\n\nThe second part will look at representation/modelling of concepts in (higher order) logic in details.  Axiomatic versus conservative extensions of theories will be covered and mechanisms such as Isabelle locales will be introduced and used. Recursive definitions and inductive notions will be covered too.\n\n\n\nThe third part of the course will focus on fundamental notions such as unification and rewriting, within both a first and higher order context. It will look at notions such as termination and use Isabelle's simplifier as the tool for understanding many of the concepts. It will also look at the interplay between (fully) automatic and interactive proofs.\n\n\n\nThe fourth part will introduce declarative/structured proofs and using the Isar language of Isabelle show how proofs resembling pencil and paper ones can be formalized.\n\n\n\nFinally the various strands will brought together through the discussion of a non-trivial case study.\n\nThis may involve either formalized mathematics (e.g. looking at a geometric theory) or a formal verification example.\n\n\n\nThe assignment will be a combination of basic to intermediate representation and reasoning in Isabelle (up to 40%), more advanced proof tackling one particular domain or example (up to 40%) and a final part which, if completed successfully, will clearly demonstrate that the student has a good of the challenges that advanced interactive theorem proving entails."}
