We discuss the different affordances of these modes and how models may be used (i) purely informally, (ii) as reviewed documentation for designs, and/or (iii) in model-driven development in which models are formal artefacts and code may be generated from them.\n\nThe second part of the course focuses on identifying and producing good designs. What principles should a good object-oriented design follow? We learn some common design patterns and their role in development and learning.\n \nFinally we turn to practical model-driven development: how can the cost-benefit ratio of modelling be improved, now and potentially in the future? Students will learn about model transformations, both model-to-model and model-to-text (e.g., code generation) and be introduced to current tools supporting these. We discuss the role of domain specific languages and the integration of model driven development with agile processes.

Are all `computers' basically the same? Can we tell whether our programs are `correct' - and what does `correct' mean, anyway? Can we solve problems in reasonable time, and can we tell whether we can?\nThe course concentrates primarily on conceptual understanding, but adds enough detail to allow students to go on to further courses, and illustrates how the fundamental concepts are reflected throughout the discipline.", "Description": "The first section of the course asks the question, what does it mean to compute? We start with very simple abstract computers, and argue they can do everything real computers can do. We then ask, can we solve every computational question? The answer, which which Turing shocked the mathematicians of the 1930s, is \"no\", with a remarkably easy but beautiful argument (introduced at the end of Inf2A). We then explore some different, but always equivalent, ways of defining \"a computer\". We finish the section by asking how we can compare the difficulty of different problems, and introduce the idea of \"reduction\" as a way of compiling one problem into another. Technically, this covers register machines, undecidability, Turing machines, and reductions. \n\nThe second section thinks about how hard it is to solve solvable problems, leading to one of the most important problems in all mathematics, and the foundation of internet security. We start by reprising Inf2A analysis of algorithms, and then discuss the idea of classifying problems as `tractable' (easy) or `intractable' (hard). We find that the idea of algorithms whose running time grows polynomially in the problem size is a good mathematical definition of `tractable', though not always a practical one. After making this more precise, we ask what happens if we're allowed to just check all the possible answers in parallel - does this give us more problem-solving power? The question is made precise by the concept of NP, and we show that there are \"hardest\" such problems, such as the famous Travelling Salesman. Although the question is easy to ask, nobody knows how to answer it. This is P = NP - if you can solve it, you win a million dollars, and fame for as long as civilization lasts.   So far, NP problems are very hard to solve in practice, so we discuss how to deal with them. We finish the section by talking about much harder problems still. Technically, this section covers P, NP, hardness and completeness, Cook's Theorem, P = NP, and the complexity hierarchy above NP. \n\nThe third section considers a different way of seeing computation. Haskell needn't be seen as a programming language, it can be the computer itself. We'll show how the lambda-calculus (on which Haskell is based) can do all the computing our other models could. Unlike the register and Turing machines, lambda-calculus lets us easily use types, which get rid of a whole class of possible bugs from our programs. This \"typing\" underlies almost all modern languages, including such recent things as generics in Java. We'll show how we can decide whether a lambda program is correct in its type, and even how we can do the typing automatically, instead of making the programmer do it. It turns out that this latter is one of those weird problems that is ridiculously hard in theory, but perfectly doable in practice, which bring us back to the complexity hierarchies of the second section. Technically, this covers lambda-calculus, simple types, polymorphism, type checking and type inference. \n\n\nRegister and Turing machines, undecidability, reductions. Intractability and growth rates. P and poly-time reductions, NP, hardness and completeness. Cook's Theorem. P = NP. Beyond NP. Lambda-calculus, through to simply-typed lambda, type safety, polymorphism, type inference and Hindley-Milner."},
